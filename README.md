# Greg-Gompers-NLP-Udacity

This is a project I built from my university machine learning engineer in degree, this shows a NLP sentiment analysis model, which takes the data from thousands of IMDb movie reviews, to make predictions on new reviews that are handed to it.

This model with another data sets such as restaurant reviews, or auto repair shop reviews, etc. this NLP algorithm could be used to specifically analyze the sentiment of any type of reviews.


The code in this notebook is mainly for the building the model itself inside of sage maker interface, and in addition to this I also built a lamb to function with in AWS environment, and an API gateway inside of AWS. With theseTo pre-processing functions, I was able to send my friends and family a website link, where they could type in a review, and instantly be delivered the prediction of whether their review was mostly positive, or mostly negative.
This was a very fun project, I enjoyed it very much! 
And I hope you do too :-)
